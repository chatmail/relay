Chatmail relay installation and maintenance
*******************************************

Chatmail relays are optimized for use by `chatmail clients <https://chatmail.at/clients>`_
of which `Delta Chat <https://delta.chat>`_ is the most prominent one.
A chatmail relay is a minimal Mail Transport Agent (MTA) setup that
goes far beyond what most classic e-mail servers offer:

-  **Zero State:** no private data or metadata collected, messages are auto-deleted, low disk usage

-  **Instant/Realtime:** sub-second message delivery, realtime P2P
   streaming, privacy-preserving Push Notifications for Apple, Google, and Huawei;

-  **Security Enforcement**: only strict TLS, DKIM and OpenPGP with minimized metadata accepted

-  **Reliable Federation and Decentralization:** No spam or IP reputation checks, federating
   depends on established IETF standards and protocols.
