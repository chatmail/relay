# Reload services that cache the TLS certificate.
#
# dovecot: caches the cert at startup; reload re-reads SSL certs
#          without dropping existing connections.
# nginx:   caches the cert at startup; reload gracefully picks up
#          the new cert for new connections.
# postfix: reads the cert fresh on each TLS handshake,
#          does NOT need a reload/restart.
